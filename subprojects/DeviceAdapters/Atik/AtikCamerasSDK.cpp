// This file simply includes the required code from the Atik SDK (the code to
// load and call the DLLs is distributed as AtikCameras.cpp).
//
// This intermediary file is used so that the path to the SDK is determined by
// project properties, rather than being hard-coded in the project. That way,
// the path is set in one place only.
